## Goal of the Project
* Create the robust "Human Resources Module Application" helps to `communicate` `manage` `update` `change` to employment records in `Employee Management System`

### In General
* Essential role of projects in the journey to becoming a full-stack web developer.
* When Apply for development jobs, portfolio is absolutely vital to opening doors to opportunities, showcases high-quality deployed examples of work.
* Fantastic opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN application.
* Employers seek evidence of both individual capabilities and collaboration with other developers.

## User Story <a ID="user-story"></a>

### This application was developed with this user story in mind:

```md
AS AN admin managing employee data
I WANT to efficiently view, add, update, and delete departments, roles, and employees
SO THAT I can maintain an organized and up-to-date employee management system
```
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Acceptance Criteria <a ID="acceptance-criteria"></a>

### This application was developed with the below User acceptance criteria:

```md
GIVEN an employee management system web application
WHEN I log in as an admin
THEN I am securely authenticated using JWT-based authentication
WHEN I access the system
THEN I am presented with options to view, add, update, and delete departments, roles, and employees
WHEN I choose to view departments, roles, and employees
THEN I am able to see a comprehensive overview of all departments, roles, and employees
WHEN I view employees by manager or department
THEN I can see the relevant employee information grouped accordingly
WHEN I view the total department budget
THEN I see the calculated budget based on employee salaries within each department
WHEN I add a new department, role, or employee
THEN I am able to input the necessary details to create a new entry in the database
WHEN I update employee roles or manager assignments
THEN I can modify relevant information to reflect accurate responsibilities and reporting structures
WHEN I delete a department, role, or employee
THEN I can efficiently remove the selected entry from the database
WHEN I interact with the user interface
THEN I find it intuitive and user-friendly, built using React components
WHEN I navigate through different views
THEN I can move seamlessly between dashboard, add employee form, and other sections using routing
without the page reloading
WHEN I perform actions like adding, updating, or deleting data
THEN I receive confirmation dialogs to ensure intentional actions are taken
```

## Installation

Please follow these steps to install, refer to, contribute, or reflect our project in your work.

1. Clone -or- Fork the repository
2. Run the below in console install necessary packages
```
npm i
```
3. After NPM packages have been installed, you'll need to set up your MySQL database for the application to read and write to. Log into MySQL2:
```
mysql -u root -p
```
4. Within mysql2 - create the datbase with the schema provided, run the below command in the root folder (the below is the relative path):
```
source ./db/schema.sql
```
5. Exit MySQL2:
```
quit
```
6. Seeding -or- populating a database with necessary data
```
npm run seed
```
7. You can run start the server once packages have been installed and the database is created. Run the below in the CLI:
```
node server.js
npm run develop
```

## Tasks

### In General
* Create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand.
* Use React for the front end.
* Use Node.js and Express.js server.
* Use MySQL2 and the Sequelize for the database.
* Use Axios for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Have a polished UI.
* Be responsive & interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Include authentication (JWT).
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).
* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

### Vite for React: Steps to follow

* To serve as a tool for quickly setting up and developing modern web applications, like React.
* Focuses on providing a fast development experience by leveraging ES module imports, pre-bundling dependencies during development, and optimizing build times.

1. In the command line, navigate to the desired parent folder and run `npm create vite@latest`.
2. Enter the desired name of new project folder.
3. From the first list of options, select framework; for activities in class, we'll be using `React`.
4. From the second list of options, select variant; for activities in class, we'll be using `JavaScript`.
5. `cd` into your newly created project folder and run `npm install`.
6. Run `npm dev`/`npm run dev` and navigate to the prompted URL to see application.

### Further customization

1. Navigate to `package.json` and modify the `scripts` object so that it looks like this example:
```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
```

2. Navigate to the `vite.config.js` file and edit the export object so that it looks like this example:
```js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    open: true
  }
})
```
